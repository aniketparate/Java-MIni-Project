# Railway-Ticket-Booking-System-JavaFx

## Introduction

Welcome to Railway-Ticket-Booking-System-JavaFx, a JavaFx-based application that allows users to login, create accounts, and book railway tickets. The system consists of two dashboards, one for regular users and another for administrators. Users can select source and destination stations, view a map to visualize stations and routes, add passenger information, and book tickets.
